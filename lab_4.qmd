### Question 1
```{r}
grades <- vroom(here("grades.csv"))
```


### Question 2

```{r}

stat <- grades |>
  summarise("Minimun" = min(Exam,na.rm = TRUE), "Maximum" = max(Exam, na.rm = TRUE), "Mean" = mean(Exam, na.rm = TRUE), "Median" = median(Exam, na.rm = TRUE))

knitr::kable(stat, align = "cccc", digits = 2, caption = "Exam statistics")
```

### Question 3

```{r}

na <- sum(is.na(grades$Exam))

```

`r na` students did not take the exam.

### Question 4



```{r}

ggplot(grades, aes(x=Exam)) + geom_histogram(bins = 20, na.rm = TRUE) + labs(y = "Number of students", title = "Distribution of the exam grades")

```
### Question 5

For question 5 and 6 we keep the students that did not take the test as they are part of groups.

```{r}

nb_group <- grades |>
  group_by(Group) |>
  summarise("Number of students" = n())

knitr::kable(nb_group, align = "c", digits = 0)



```

### Question 6

```{r}

ggplot(nb_group, aes(y=`Number of students`, x = Group )) + geom_col() + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle=90))

```

### Question 7

```{r}

exam <- grades |>
  group_by(Group) |>
  select(Exam)

ggplot(exam, aes(y=Exam, x = Group )) + geom_violin()  + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle=90)) + labs(y = "Exam grades", title = "Distribution of the exam grades by group")

ggplot(exam, aes(y=Exam, x = Group )) + geom_boxplot()  + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle=90)) + labs(y = "Exam grades", title = "Distribution of the exam grades by group")

```

### Question 8

```{r}

miss <- grades %>%
  group_by(Group) %>%
  summarize(Students_Missed_Exam = sum(is.na(Exam)))

```
### Question 9

```{r}

ggplot(miss, aes(y=`Students_Missed_Exam`, x = Group )) + geom_col() + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle=90))+ labs(y = "Number of students who missed the exam", title = "Number of students who missed the exam by group")

```
### Question 10

```{r}

grades_long <- grades %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = -c(Id, Group), names_to = "type_exam", values_to = "Score")

```

### Question 11

```{r}
grades_NA <- grades_long %>%
  group_by(Id) %>%
  summarize(NA_total = sum(is.na(Score)))

```

### Question 12

```{r}
ggplot(grades_NA, aes(x = NA_total)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1, fill = "blue", color = "black") +
  labs(
    title = "Distribution of missing grades per student",
    x = "Total Missing Grades",
    y = "Frequency"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()

```
